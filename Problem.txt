215 = 32768 and the sum of its digits is 3 + 2 + 7 + 6 + 8 = 26.
What is the sum of the digits of the number 21000?

Given,
2^15 = 32768
So that 
2^1000 = 21000

First we need to find the digits of 2100 and sum each digit sequentially.
I have used python to solve this problem.
 
First integer value of 2^1000 is changed to string value to identify its digits and counter sumDigits with zero value is created to store the value of sum of digits.
Then using the for loop each digits were separated and added and stored in sumDigits variable.
